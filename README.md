# arc-web3
I made my own Web3 library because why not?

This currently only provides read-only access to the Ethereum network, as signing transactions isn't implemented yet.

Right now this only works with HTTP, but I'm planning to add websocket support and events for both Websocket and HTTP connections in the very near future.

Documentation too, can't have an actually usable library without good documentation!
