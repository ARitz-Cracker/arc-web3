# arc-web3
I made my own Web3 library because why not?

Originally created because I couldn't stand the absolute pile of garbage spaghetti that is web3js, `arc-web3` has become the fully-featured, extremly-overdue, WebAssembly-based Ethereum JavaScript library that the Ethereum community needs, but frankly doesn't deserve. On its own, `arc-web3` provides read-only access to the Ethereum network in both NodeJS, and the browser. (Write access is achived either through the provided endpoint being able to sign transactions, or optional dependencies like `arc-web3-signable-accounts`.

Take a look at [the docs!](https://github.com/ARitz-Cracker/arc-web3/wiki)
